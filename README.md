SUMMARY: "This project presents a comprehensive computational analysis of the ORF3 gene sequence from Sesamum indicum. Using an integrated bioinformatics pipeline, the gene was identified as encoding a putative F-box protein, characterized by a specific F-box domain and FBD/LRR repeats. Physicochemical analysis revealed the protein is stable and basic, while secondary structure prediction indicated a predominantly alpha-helical conformation. Subcellular localization tools strongly predicted a nuclear location for the protein. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated evolutionary conservation with dicot homologs, particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, protein-protein interaction networks confirmed its functional role within the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, suggesting involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system."
