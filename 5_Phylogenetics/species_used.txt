"The phylogenetic analysis reveals that the F-box protein is evolutionarily conserved across diverse plant species. The tree topology shows distinct clustering, where the Sesamum indicum homolog (XP_020547129.1) shares a recent common ancestor with PIN18359.1, forming a tight clade. This indicates a high degree of sequence conservation and likely functional similarity, while other branches (e.g., DAD20794.1) represent more distant evolutionary divergence."
